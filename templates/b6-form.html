    <h2>Connecting html form to the back end</h2>
    <p>I create an html form. I can fill it and when I push enter or submit, I can see my choices indicated in the URL.
        So I can work with the data. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We need to set the action attribute. This will be the URL we want the form to submit to.</li>
        <li><strong>
                &lt;form
                action="&#123;{ url_for('add_pet') }}" method="POST" ></strong></li>
        <li>The POST attribute will send our form data to our add_pet route. Then we can play with the data. But first,
            we need to make sure our route knows it is going to be receiving some data. </li>
        <li>In app.py, add_pet route, change the decorator to <strong>@app.route('/add-pet', methods=['GET',
                'POST'])</strong></li>
        <li>We need both because this route is used to get our addpet page and show it to the user and now will be also
            receiving our form data via a post.</li>
        <li>to make sure we can see our data, import request: <strong>from flask import (Flask, render_template,
                url_for,
                request)</strong></li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Code for that</h2>

    <pre><code>
    @app.route('/add-pet', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def add_pet():
        print(request.form)
        print(request.form['age'])
        return render_template('addpet.html')
    </code></pre>
    <p>request.form return an immutable multi dictionary, when I fill the form (no longer passed via the URL). The keys
        come from the name attribute on the form inputs. </p>
    <pre>
        ImmutableMultiDict([
        ('name', 'MÃ©dor'), ('age', '1 year'), 
        ('breed', 'Corgy'), ('url', ''), 
        ('color', 'Marroon'), ('size', 'small'), 
        ('weight', '5 kg'), ('alt', ''), 
        ('pet', 'Dog'), ('gender', 'Male'), 
        ('spay', 'Unknown'), ('housetrained', 'Yes'),
        ('description', "Queen's dog")])
    </pre>

    <h2>Quick review : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When a form is submitted, the browser looks at the action and method attributes on the form to see what it
            should do with the information. Here, we are telling flask to insert the route for the add_pet function. The
            browser says OK, I need to send this information from this form as a POST to this route.</li>
        <li>The application then receives this information and now has access to the data submitted by the form because
            the route now accepts information or POST requests.</li>
        <li>Now that we have our form submitting we can work on saving the data in a database and displaying on the
            homepage.</li>
    </ul>
